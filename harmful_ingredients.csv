Harmful Ingredients,Ingredients Description,,,,,
Food Colour,"There is no conclusive evidence that food dyes are dangerous for most people. Nevertheless, they may cause allergic reactions in some people and hyperactivity in sensitive children. However, most food dyes are found in unhealthy processed foods that should be avoided anyway.",,,,,
Hydrogenated Palm Oil,"The hydrogenation process creates trans fats, which are unhealthy for the heart and should be avoided.",,,,,
Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein,"While a source of umami flavor and protein, some processes used to hydrolyze proteins may result in the formation of monosodium glutamate (MSG). Some people may be sensitive to MSG and experience symptoms like headaches after consuming it.",,,,,
Stabilizer 461 & 407,"Stabilizers like methylcellulose (461) and carrageenan (407) are used to improve texture. While they are approved for use, some studies suggest carrageenan might contribute to gastrointestinal inflammation.",,,,,
Thickener $45,Xanthan gum (415) is typically recognized as safe for most people. It's used as a thickening agent but can cause digestive issues in large amounts.,,,,,
Flavour Enhancers 627 & 631,Disodium guanylate (627) and Disodium inosinate (631) often accompany MSG (621) and can cause similar reactions in sensitive individuals.,,,,,
Palm Oil ,"When a regular fat like corn, soybean, or palm oil is blasted with hydrogen and turned into a solid, it becomes a trans fat. These evil anti-nutrients help packaged foods stay ""fresh,"" meaning that the food can sit on the supermarket shelf for years without ever getting stale or rotting. Eating junk food with trans fats raises your ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and lowers your ""good"" HDL. These fats also increase your risk of blood clots and heart attack. Avoid palm oil and other trans fats like the plague, and kiss fried foods goodbye too, since they're usually fried in one of these freakish trans-fatty oils.",,,,,
 Shortening,"Ditch any food that lists shortening or partially hydrogenated oil as an ingredient, since these are also evil trans fats. In addition to clogging your arteries and causing obesity, they also increase your risk of metabolic syndrome. Choose healthier monounsaturated fats, such as olive, peanut and canola oils and foods that contain unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids instead.",,,,,
High Fructose Corn Syrup,"The evil king of all refined grains is high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). The amount of refined sugar we consume has declined over the past 40 years, but we're consuming almost 20 times as much HFCS. According to researchers at Tufts University, Americans consume more calories from HFCS than any other source. It's in practically EVERYTHING. It increases triglycerides, boosts fat-storing hormones, and drives people to overeat and gain weight. Adopt my zero-tolerance policy, and steer clear of this sweet ""poison.""",,,,,
Artificial Sweeteners,"Aspartame (NutraSweet, Equal), saccharin (Sweet'N Low, SugarTwin), and sucralose (Splenda) may be even harder on our metabolic systems than plain old sugar. These supposedly diet-friendly sweeteners may actually be doing more harm than good! Studies suggest that artificial sweeteners trick the brain into forgetting that sweetness means extra calories, making people more likely to keep eating sweet treats without abandon. Nip it in the bud. Scan ingredient labels and ban all artificial sweeteners from entering your mouth.",,,,,
 Sodium Benzoate and Potassium Benzoate,"These preservatives are sometimes added to soda to prevent mold from growing, but benzene is a known carcinogen that is also linked with serious thyroid damage. Dangerous levels of benzene can build up when plastic bottles of soda are exposed to heat or when the preservatives are combined with ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Don't risk it, people",,,,,
 Butylated Hydroxyanisole (BHA),"BHA is another potentially cancer-causing preservative, but it has been deemed safe by the FDA. Its job is to help prevent spoilage and food poisoning, but it's a major endocrine disruptor and can seriously mess with your hormones. BHA is in HUNDREDS of foods. It's also found in food packaging and cosmetics. BHA has many aliases. You can look them up. Or you can follow my advice and DITCH processed foods altogether.",,,,,
Sodium Nitrates and Sodium Nitrites,"No that's not a typo. These two different preservatives are found in processed meats like bacon, lunch meat, and hot dogs. They're some of the worst offenders, and they're believed to cause colon cancer and metabolic syndrome, which can lead to diabetes. Protect your health by always choosing fresh, organic meats.",,,,,
" Blue, Green, Red, and Yellow"," The artificial colors blue 1 and 2, green 3, red 3, and yellow 6 have been linked to thyroid, adrenal, bladder, kidney, and brain cancers. Always seek out foods with the fewest artificial chemicals, especially when shopping for your kids. Look for color-free medications and natural food products that don't contain artificial colors like these.",,,,,
MSG ,"Monosodium glutamate is a processed ""flavor enhancer."" While glutamates are present in some natural foods, such as meat and cheese, the ones exploited by the processed-foods industry are separated from their host proteins through hydrolysis. The jury is still out on how harmful MSG may be, but high levels of free glutamates have been shown to seriously screw with brain chemistry. Don't fall prey to chemical flavor enhancing. Just play it safe and flavor your food naturally. Found in soups, frozen foods, chips, 'beef flavouring' and fast food. MSG is used to enhance a food's flavour but it blocks signals telling your brain that you are full. You shouldn't be eating foods that require a 'flavour enhancer' like MSG.",,,,,
Guar Gum,"Guar gum is a long-chain carbohydrate used to thicken and bind foods. It’s widely used in the food industry and can be found in ice cream, salad dressings, sauces and soups.",,,,,
Glyphosate,"Glyphosate is a herbicide that is widely used in agriculture. It has been classified as a probable carcinogen by the World Health Organization. Glyphosate is banned in several countries, including Sri Lanka and Vietnam, but is still allowed in India.",,,,, 
Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO),"BVO is an emulsifier used in many citrus-flavored soft drinks. It has been linked to health issues such as neurological disorders and thyroid problems. BVO is banned in several countries, including Japan and the European Union, but is still allowed in India.",,,,,
Processed meat," Hot dogs, lunch meat, and canned meats are classified as a 'Group 1' carcinogen with 'convincing evidence' that they cause colorectal and stomach cancer. They contain nitrates and phosphates shown to stiffen arteries. Do yourself a favour and opt for fresh meat.",,,,,
Sucralose,"Found in diet sodas, dressings, syrups and energy drinks, sucralose is an artificial sweetener that is harmful to good gut bacteria. Sucralose may cause migraines, worsened moods and inflammation. 'Zero sugar' sounds great until you see it includes sucralose",,,,,
Dyes - Red 3 and Red 40,"Red 40 is the most used dye in America. Linked to thyroid tumours in rats, a ban was proposed on Red 3 but was never implemented in America despite being banned entirely in the UK & Switzerland. These dyes are in cereals, pastries, cocktails and fruit snacks.",,,,,
Azodicarbonamide,"A common ingredient in most mass-produced bread-based products, Azodicarbonamide is used as a whitening agent in flour and to make bread more elastic. This ingredient causes lung and blood cancer in mice and is also linked to cancer in humans. Avoid this.",,,,,
Caramel colouring,"Sounds harmless, right? I thought so too. 'Caramel colouring' is made by combining sugar with ammonia (producing carcinogens). Proven to cause cancer in animals and is likely the same in humans. Just another reason to stop drinking soda.",,,,,
Sodium Phosphate,"This additive keeps meats moist and tender during storage (red flag). Inorganic phosphate is easily absorbed by the body and increases the risk of high blood pressure and heart disease. It is linked to kidney disease, weaker bones, and premature death.",,,,,
Yeast Extract ,"Yeast extract is high in sodium and contains glutamate, which may trigger symptoms in some people. Yet because only small amounts of yeast extract are added to foods, it’s unlikely to cause problems for most people.",,,,,
Sodium Phosphate,"This additive keeps meats moist and tender during storage (red flag). Inorganic phosphate is easily absorbed by the body and increases the risk of high blood pressure and heart disease. It is linked to kidney disease, weaker bones, and premature death.",,,,,
Artificial Flavoring,"Artificial flavors are chemicals designed to mimic the taste of other ingredients.They can be used to imitate a variety of different flavors, from popcorn and caramel to fruit and beyond.One study found that the red blood cell production in rats was significantly reduced after they were fed artificial flavorings for seven days.Look for “chocolate” or “cocoa” on the ingredients label rather than “chocolate flavoring” or “artificial flavoring.”",,,,,
Xanthan Gum ,"Xanthan gum is a common additive that’s used to thicken and stabilize many types of food such as salad dressings, soups, syrups and sauces.One study found that consuming rice with added xanthan gum resulted in lower levels of blood sugar than consuming rice without it.Another study also found that eating xanthan gum for six weeks reduced levels of blood sugar and cholesterol, plus increased feelings of fullness .If you do experience negative symptoms after eating xanthan gum, it’s best to reduce your intake or consider eliminating it from your diet.- Xanthan gum may help reduce levels of blood sugar and cholesterol. In large amounts, it may cause digestive issues like gas and soft stools.",,,,,
Trans Fat,"Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat that have undergone hydrogenation, which increases shelf life and improves the consistency of products.It can be found in many types of processed foods like baked goods, margarine, microwave popcorn and biscuits.One study found that eating foods high in trans fats increased several markers of inflammation, which is one of the major risk factors for heart disease  Research also shows there may be a connection between trans fats and diabetes.Eating trans fats has been associated with many negative effects on health, including inflammation, heart disease and diabetes.",,,,,
High fructose corn syrup (HFCS),"HFCS is a sweetener made from corn and is widely used in ultra-processed foods. Due to the abundant use of HFCS in many packaged foods, it makes it easy for consumers to get too much. Like sucrose (table sugar), HFCS is comprised of glucose and fructose (which is the sweetest of all sugars); however, HFCS has a slightly higher ratio of fructose, whereas table sugar is 50/50. This becomes important because fructose is metabolized differently than glucose and excess fructose from processed foods can be problematic for liver health. Ultimately, HFCS is another source of added sugar in the diet to watch out for.A clinical study of 85 participants found a dose-dependent association between high fructose corn syrup intake and increased liver fat and worsened glucose parameters, suggesting a contribution to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes.",,,,,
Added sugar,"At this point it is well known that high sugar intake is bad for us. But it's not just the sugar we add to our baked goods or coffee that we need to be monitoring. It’s important to note that packaged foods and beverages are a major contributor to high sugar intake. Even foods that are generally nutritious, like yogurt, can contain too much sugar. Be sure to look at the nutrition facts breakdown where you will find how much accounts for added sugar specifically.",,,,,
Synthetic preservatives,"Preservatives in foods can be natural, such as rosemary extract. But the synthetic ones are on my “avoid” list. BHA/BHT and TBHQ are synthetic compounds with antioxidant properties, used to help prevent oils and fats from oxidizing, for example. While both the FDA and international agencies recognize it as safe when consumed in levels allowed in foods, there are some reports that BHT can affect sleeping, induce changes in serotonin and norepinephrine, and some consider it to be an endocrine disruptor. You’re better off opting for foods with a shorter shelf life.",,,,,
Enriched wheat,"This flour has been processed to remove the bran and endosperm of the wheat grain, leaving you without essential nutrients such as fiber, B vitamins, vitamin E and minerals. Look for whole wheat as the first ingredient in any grain product.",,,,,
Carrageenan,"Carrageenan is a food additive extracted from seaweed. It is used to help thicken foods and is commonly found in low-fat dairy products and dairy alternatives to make them feel creamier. Research has linked it to gastrointestinal diseases (Crohn’s disease, abdominal pain, etc.) and inflammation, which then leads to heart disease, cancers and diabetes with constant inflammation.",,,,,
"Bisphenol A, aka BPA","BPA is not necessarily a food ingredient, but is found in the epoxy resin lining aluminum cans, the lining of some glass jar lids, cash register receipts and some plastic bottles and containers.The FDA has banned it in baby bottles and infant formula containers, but it’s still allowed in the others.There is more and more research linking BPA to many reproductive disorders, such as infertility, cancer and abnormalities in child growth. Look for BPA-free cans and containers and avoid microwaving in plastic.",,,,,
Brominated vegetable oil,"Brominated vegetable oil is used in sports drinks and sodas as an emulsifier—a substance that helps blend liquids that don’t otherwise blend easily, such as oil and water. (According to the FDA, it keeps citrus flavorings from separating and floating to the top of the beverage.) According to a database hosted by the EWG, it’s used in about 70 sodas and beverages, most of them vibrantly colored and citrus-flavored. Peer-reviewed studies conducted on rodents have linked brominated vegetable oil (BVO) to neurological problems; thyroid, heart and liver problems; and behavioral, developmental and reproductive issues. ",,,,,
Potassium bromate,"Potassium bromate is a flour “improver,” added to strengthen dough, make baked goods rise higher in the oven, and enhance their texture. The EWG counts some 190 products containing potassium bromate, including many packaged breads, dumplings, and frozen foods. Potassium bromate has been linked to cancer. ",,,,,
Propyl paraben,"Propyl paraben is used as a preservative, extending the shelf life of packaged foods by preventing growth of mold and bacteria. It can be found in more than 50 products in U.S. grocery stores, including many packaged corn tortillas, baked desserts, and cake icing, according to the EWG. Propyl paraben has been shown to cause endocrine disruption and reproductive issues in lab animal testing. ",,,,,
Red Dye No. 3,"Red Dye No. 3, also known as FD&C Red No. 3, red dye 3, and erythrosine, is a food coloring used to give a bright, cherry-red color to thousands of food products now on shelves, including candies, baked goods, snacks, cereals, and sodas. Red Dye No. 3 has been found to cause cancer and thyroid tumors in lab animals and has been linked to hyperactivity and other neurobehavioral effects in children. Health effects like these led the FDA to ban its use in cosmetics more than 30 years ago. ",,,,,
Titanium dioxide ,"Titanium dioxide is also used as a food coloring, in this case to make coffee creamers, baking decorations, and sauces appear whiter than they otherwise would, and in some candy and other products as a kind of “paint primer” to make other colors, added later, appear more vivid. Titanium dioxide has been linked to digestive tract problems, and it was banned in Europe because scientists there could not rule out genotoxicity, the ability of the substance to damage genetic information in the body’s cells",,,,,
Sulfites,Used to keep prepared foods fresh. Can cause breathing difficulties in those sensitive to the ingredient.,,,,,
Tert butylhydroquinone, Used to preserve fish products. Could cause stomach tumors at high doses.,,,,,
